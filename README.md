<p>Adding elements to the page is done using a JS file that takes data from package.json</p>
<p>When you click on any of the elements on the page, a modal window pops up, which requires authorization before proceeding with any actions on the page.</p>
<p>When authorizing, the data is stored in localStorage</p>
<p>It is also possible to add critters to the cart. In the basket, using the "+" and "-" buttons, it is possible to increase or decrease the number of items. When you click on the "Cancel" button, the data in the shopping cart is reset</p>
